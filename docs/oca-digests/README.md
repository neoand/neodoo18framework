# OCA Digests

This folder contains auto-generated digests from the OCA repositories configured in `.neodoo/oca_watch.yml`.

How it works:
- A scheduled GitHub Action runs nightly to check for new releases or commits in watched OCA repositories
- When updates are found, a markdown digest file is created/updated here and a PR is opened
- The PR is labeled and assigned automatically; auto-merge is enabled

Manual runs: You can also trigger the workflow manually via the "OCA Watch" workflow dispatch.

## Weekly Rollups

In addition to daily digests, a weekly rollup aggregates the last 7 days into a single report per ISO week.

- Generated by `neodoo18framework/scripts/oca_rollup.py`
- Output path: `docs/oca-digests/rollups/YYYY-Www.md` (e.g., 2025-W01)
- Scheduled workflow: `OCA Weekly Rollup` runs Mondays at 03:00 UTC and can also be triggered manually
- PRs are labeled `weekly-rollup` in addition to `oca-digests` and `automation`, assigned to `@neoand`, and auto-merge is enabled
